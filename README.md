Hi! And thank you for choosing us! Let's have little time to talk about ourselves (Unfortunately, myself. No one works for me or with me :( ). I am "86213643%0901£$!$@%£%%^$* 9193a" And I am the founder of Pycrosoft. You see, here at Pycrosoft, we make things very original. The name Pycrosoft was invented, but disaster happened! A COMPANY USED OUR NAME AND CHANGED TO "MICROSOFT"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AND RUBIKS COPIED MY LOGO AND TURNED INTO A RUBIKS 2X2X2X2X2X2X2X2 CUBE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We also make things with Python. We are just gonna create one thing alright.
